//THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION: OBJECTS
//IN CLASS OBJECT EXERCISES

// For any methods that we didn't cover, please refer to the Object Documentation.
// Please console.log("Question#") followed by console.log(yourAnswer) after each question.
// If you would like, practice using document.write() as well. Use any elements you like!
// ==========================================================================

// 1. Create an object called "me" that describes you with your name, city, and job title.

//console.log("Question 1");
//console.log(yourAnswer);

// 2. To your "me" object, add a key of "family" with the value being an array of three of your family members.
// Example of desired output: { name: 'Bob Smith',
//                              city: 'Denver',
//                              jobTitle: 'professional wrestler',
//                               family: ['Joan', 'Kyle', 'Hank'] }

// 3. Using the "me" object, use two different methods of accessing your city.

// Use the following Object for questions 4-9:

// 4. Access Penny's dinner choice (this will be the second item in his dinneChoice array)

// 5. Access Pablo's table number.

// 6. Access Lauren's seating specialConsiderations.

    //added 's' after specialConsideration so it is the same as in the object above

// 7. Access Billy's dessert choice (this will be the third item in his dinneChoice array)

// 8. Access Ada's allergies.

// 9. Create a string that reads Lauren's dinner choice in a sentence.
// Desired result: "Lauren's appetizer is _______. She will be eating ______ for dinner
// and has selected ________ as her dessert."

// 10. Create an empty object called "jsWorkshop" using Constructor Notation.

// 11. To your "jsWorkshop" object, assign a key of "classmates" with the value being an array of five your classmates.

// 12. Acesss the third classmate in your "jsWorkshop" object.

// 13. Get the length of the fourth classmate's name.

// 14. Clear the classmates value.

// 15. Create an emtpy array called "books".
// Create three objects that contain book titles, their author, and number of pages.
// Insert the three objects into the "books" array.
// (Feel free to make up the titles. And the authors. Have fun. No pressure.)
// Example of desired array: [ youHadMeAtWoof, bangkokHaunts, theCatcherInTheRye]
// Example of desired object: {title: "You Had Me at Woof", author: "Julie Klum", pages: 207}
// Final desired result:
    var books = [{youHadMeAtWoof: {title: "You Had Me at Woof",
                                  author: "Julie Klum",
                                  pages: 207
                                  },

                                  title: "The Catcher in the Rye",
                                  author: "JD Salinger",

                                  author: "John Burdett",
                                  pages: 569,
                                  }
                }]
// 15a. Access the author of the first book.

// 15b. Print the length of the author the the third book.

// 16. To each book object variable, add a key of "dateRead" with a value of the year you read the book.
// (Go ahead and make this up, too. Get wild.)

// 17. Remove the second book from the books Array.

// Bonus: Explain, in your own words, the difference between Literal Notation and Constructor.

// 17. Let's play a game. Create an object (like we did with the bike in class) and assign it at least five properties.
// The class will guess what your object is based on it's properties.

// You're a zookeeper and keeping a detailed log of each of the animals in your zoo.
// 18. Create an empty object called "zoo"

// 19. Create assign three animals as your keys in the "zoo" object. The values of the animals should be empty objects.

// 20. Within each animal empty object, assign a key/value pair of "timeSlept" and a number indicating the hours of sleep each animal got. (Make this up, obvi)

// 21. Within each animal object, assign a object pair consisting of a key called "meals" and an empty array as the value.

// 22. Within each animal's meals array, create two objects with keys of "monday" and "wednesday". You only feed those jerks twice a week. It's fine.

// 23. In the individual days of the week, create an object with the key of each meal ("breakfast", "lunch", "dinner") and a made up value of what they ate.
// That array should look like this (within the meals object, within the animal object, within the zoo object):
  [ { monday: {
    breakfast: "cheetos on top of greek yogurt",
    lunch: "6 gallons of Diet Coke",
    dinner: "leftover lasagna"
  }},
   {wednesday: {
    breakfast: "cashews, diced apples, tuna, grapes, BubbleYum",
    lunch: "a ham and cheddar lunchable",
    dinner: "I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it"
  }}]

// 24. Damn it. The night zookeeper just informed you that your second animal took a nap right before bed time. Add two hours to his "timeSlept" value.

// 25. To each animal object, add a "favoriteActivities" key with the value being an array of three of his/her favorite activities.

// 26. Your first animal just tossed his lunch at the zoo visitors. Change his monday lunch value to an empty string.

// 27. You know your "zoo" object? The owner wants to add zookeepers to the object, too. But before we do that, we need to make sure
// the animals stay separate from the zookeepers. To do this, create an object within the "zoo" object. The key will be "animals" and the value will be an array
// containing the three animals you already defined.

// 28. To the "zoo" object, add an object named "zookeepers" with the value being and empty object.

// 29. To the empty "zookeepers" object, add two objects with their keys being two names and their values being an empty object.

// 30. This joker wants you to add the "hireDate" for each zookeeper. Within the empty array attached to each name, assign a key/value pair of
// "hireDate" and the value being a string of hire date.
