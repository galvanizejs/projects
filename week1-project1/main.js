//1. Log your name to the console (as a string).
console.log('Gordon Graham');
document.write('Gordon Graham');
//2. Declare a variable called name, log it to the console.
var name='Gordon';
console.log(name);
document.write(name);
//3. Declare two variables with number values. Add, subtract, multiply and divide them.
var num1=3;
var num2=-3;
console.log(num1 + num2);
console.log(num1 - num2);
console.log(num1 * num2);
console.log(num1 / num2);
//4. Declare two variables with string values. Create a third variable that concatenates them.
var str1 = "JavaScript is...";
var str2 = "AWESOME";
var str3 = str1 + str2;
console.log(str3);
document.write(str3);
//5. Add, subract, multiply and divide the strings '5' and '3'. Observe and explain the results.
