// JavaScript Function Exercises

// 1. Define a function called "divideByTwo". It should accept one parameter called "number".
//    The function should divide the number by two and output the answer.

// 2. Define a function called "greeting". It should accept two parameters, which will be names.
//    The function should output the a greeting to both people.

// 3. You use Amazon Subscribe & Save to have six cans of cashews automatically sent to you each month, but the price keeps changing.
//    Write a function that takes the price per unit and calculates the total for you each month.

// 4. Write a function that accepts the following array and separates the people into two teams.
//    No names next to eachother in the array should be on the same team.
      teammates = ["Harold", "Bob", "Sue", "Grady", "Notorious B.I.G.", "JavaCrypt", "Weird guy in the back", "Gary", "Carol", "Hipster Tim", "Janet"]

// 5. Define a function called "quarter". It accepts one parameter called "number".
//    The function will return a value which is one quarter of the number provided.
//    Call the function inside of a conditional statement that prints one statement if the value is even or another statement if the value is odd.
//    In pseudocode:
//                  defining my function here(parameter)
//                      returns a value that divides that parameter by 4
//
//                  if (calling the function with parameter divided by 2 is even)
//                      print out a statement saying the number is even
//                  else
//                      print out a statement saying the number is odd

// 6. Define functions called "area" and "perimeter". They should both accept two parameters and calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

// 7. Write a function called "sleepings", it should accept one parameter, an integer called "hours".
//    Write a conditional statement inside of the function. If the number of hours is more than 8, print a statement to the console about getting enough rest.
//    If the number of hours is less than 8, print a statement recommending the user get more shut eye.

// 8. Prompt a user to enter a six digit number. Write a function that reverses the number.
//    (Hint, you will have to turn the integer into a string before you can reverse it.)

// 9. Within the fuction you wrote in #7, write a conditional statement that checks to ensure the user entered a six digit integer.
//    If they have not entered a six digit integer, give them a message about being a failure.

// 10. You've finally gotten around to counting the change in your piggy bank. Write a function that accepts four parameters (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
//     The function should take each number of coins and multiply it times each coin's value.
//     Finally, it should return the total amount of change you have in the following format: "$32.77"

// 11. Develop a function that determines a person's age by prompting them for their birth year.

// 12. Write a function that takes a year and reports whether or not it is a leap year.
//     Remember, a leap year occurs:
//        On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//        Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//        Unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
//        For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leapyear, but 2000 is

// 13. Develop a function that cleans up a phone number entered by a user.
//     The rules are as follows:
//        If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad number
//        If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the last 10 digits
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
//        If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad number

// 14. Create a function that determines whether a parameter is a number or not (Hint: google "isNan")
//     Iterate over the elements in the following array to determine if each is a number.
       arrayOfAllTheThings = ["one", 23, {thingsWhalesLove: "beaches"}, "six hundred", 33, 6834, "5,435"]

// 15. Create a die rolling function that accepts two parameters (the two six-sided dice) and outputs an array of the two values rolled.

// 16. Create another fuction called "whichSide". It will accept the array from above as it's only parameter.
//     This function will mimic a Monopoly board. Start playerOne at the Go space (0) and add the two values from your die array to determine
//     how many spaces the player will move. Log to the console which side of the board the player is on.
//     Hint: each side has 11 spaces. You can call the sides of the board: north, east, south, west or top, right, bottom, left.

// 17. Using the game above, use the same function(s) and add additional code to determine if the player is on a corner spot.
//     Log to the console which corner the player is located.
